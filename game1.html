            One of the particularly attractive mobile runners, Subway Surfers, offers players the opportunity to feel like graffiti artists overcoming their limitations. The player and the protagonist are in constant motion, trying to escape from the police and catch a troublemaker who has painted a subway car. Following him, you must collect bonuses, constantly take shortcuts from various objects, and try not to lose speed. The game is distinguished by a cheerful and colorful icon with the image of a funny and cunning protagonist with a can of paint in his hand. In the background, in the car window, you can see the outlines of city skyscrapers in a blue translucent haze, immediately referring to the game’s storyline.
