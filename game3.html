            Taking care of your pet, a quirky creature named Pow is the main plot of the original and exciting game. To do this, the user is provided with everything necessary. It is required to take care of the character – bathe and dress him, feed him, play and talk to him, collect coins, and experiment with potions. The main thing is to provide Pow with timely nutrition and a good mood, keeping his health at the proper level. The game is very similar to the once popular “Tamagotchi.” The game’s icon was the character’s image in its fancy shape and light brown color. Today, it has become world famous, and the cute “face” with a shy smile drawn on the side began to appear on the monitors and displays of many gadgets.
