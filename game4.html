            The continuation of the much-loved runner – Temple Run number 2 immediately became a hit of downloads. It increased the number of obstacles of various types, bonuses, and other features. To keep recognizability and attract the attention of fans of the first release, the visual appearance of the sequel was made in the same style but individually. This was reflected in the color scheme, in which a red hue and the traditional light orange appeared. The badge became brighter and more accurately reflected the traditional ornamental style of Latin American Indians. In the lower part of the composition, there is a symbolic image of a mountain stream running on a scattering of scattered stones, which indicates the appearance of new elements in the game.
