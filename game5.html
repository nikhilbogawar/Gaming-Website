            Almost flying up a steep hill, the cartoon car from Hill Climb Racing has become the most famous icon among fans of racing video games with simple animation. Captivating and appealing with its uncomplicated plot and colorfulness, the game platform requires you to complete the track with your car as far as possible, overcoming various obstacles, performing dizzying stunts, and collecting coins. Its icon with a sky azure background, which depicts a cartoon character sitting behind the wheel of his bright red car and overcoming a steep slope with light green grass, immediately attracts attention. In contrast, a brown dirt road is added. The sense of motion, speed, and power with which the car overcomes the obstacle is created by the rocks flying out from under the rear wheel and the gaps of the front wheel between the ground and the body.
