            My Talking Tom, a 3D mobile pet simulator, is popular today. Being the 14th installment of the beloved series of games “Talking Tom and Friends,” this release offers its users an unforgettable, daily fun adventure. At the same time, the character can speak, which radically distinguishes the platform from similar ones, making it unique and especially attractive. The choice in favor of this game is especially influenced by the icon with a simple, modestly smiling “face” of the gray-haired hero, the owner of piercing huge emerald eyes, pale pink ears, and a “leather” nose.
