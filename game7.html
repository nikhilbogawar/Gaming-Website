            Despicable Me is a series of video games about the favorite cartoon character from the movie of the same name and his minions. All games are addictive and endless runners with plenty of playable locations taken from the movie plots. Running, sliding, dodging with many levels, items, and prizes, constantly updated goals and tasks, and a wide range of costumes are the basis of this incredible game world. The icons of each game are characterized by the richness and depth of bright colors, which are accentuated with darker tones for greater appeal, providing cheerfulness and appeal characteristic of the created game atmosphere. Each icon utilizes an image of the game’s main character, rendered in a distinctive style that reflects his character and features.
