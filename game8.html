            One of the most downloaded video games was a platform from Finnish developers – Angry Birds. The game aims to take revenge on greedy pigs stealing bird eggs. The player must launch birds at pigs from a slingshot, destroying their shelters for this purpose. All pigs must be destroyed to complete the level. A bright and colorful icon was created to identify the game, depicting an incredibly round bright red “angry bird” against a background of rays of dark and light blue shades diverging from it. The contours of the character and the frowning and angry eyebrows are made in black for the best perception and memory of the emblem. The central element of the composition – a yellow beak – adds personality to the image, making it more attractive.
