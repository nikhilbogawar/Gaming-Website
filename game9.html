            Video arcade from Australian developers – Fruit Ninja is one of the leaders in the number of downloads. Its gameplay is based on the need to cut the appearing fruits quickly and accurately with a sword. The game requires attention, good reaction, and accuracy. The presence of different modes and a large selection of cutting tools allow you to reduce the “thorny” path to the best achievements. Attractively and originally made, the icon also helps to choose a favor for this toy. It is based on the image of a sharp knife with a shiny blade, which on the fly disposes of a juicy watermelon, whose bright scarlet splashes of sweet juice spread over the realistically made surface of a wooden cutting board.
